# Common Libraries

## Structure

Common libraries are divided into several subprojects, each of which can be imported independently.

Most libraries serve as enhancements to the fundamental frameworks.
Check the `README.md` of each library for more details.

## Contribution

If you have code that other applications could use, consider contributing it to common libraries.

Generally, only business-agnostic code should be added to libraries.

Additionally, ensure that functions added to the common libraries are well-tested and documented.
